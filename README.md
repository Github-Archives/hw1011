Create a circular queue implemented on a 1D array, size 10.

Initialize one random number generator with seed 3.

Modify the insert and delete code so that errors are ignored.

Repeat the following 3 times:
  Generate a random number x between 1 and 5
  Repeat x times:
    Generate a random number a between 0 and 99
    Insert a to the queue
  Generate a random number y between 1 and 5
  Repeat y times:
    Delete from the queue

Output the resulting queue.  If the queue is empty, output: "Empty queue".

Constraints:
(1) Must use a 1D array circular queue.
(2) Must use a single random number generator, which is seeded with 3.

Points taken off for:
(1) Doesn't work
(2) Fails to meet style constraints
(3) Code does not match output
(4) Ugly or difficult to understand code

Turn in:
(1) Hard copy of code
(2) Header with your last name, home work identifier (hw1011), URL of source code
(3) Screen shot showing program execution
